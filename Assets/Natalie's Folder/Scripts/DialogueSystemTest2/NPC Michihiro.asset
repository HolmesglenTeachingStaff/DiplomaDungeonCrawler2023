  dialogue:
  - 'Hello there, hmm... you don''t seem familiar. Judging from your appearance,
    I assume you''re just a lost soul. '
  - 'Well, all of the entities that live here are all demons here that have been
    banished, which means they don''t have souls in them with maybe one exception.
    I can tell you''ve got a human soul which tells me that you''re a human! '
  - Hmmm... I guess you could say I'm the person in charge here. Keeping track of
    all the guests, making sure they don't misbehave, stuff like that. I also belong
    to one of the divine heaven commisions.
  - 'Oh you poor soul, must be quite scary being alone here. Ofcourse, I''d love
    you help you. Feel free to come to me to ask any questions you''ve got and I''ll
    answer them to the best of my abilities. Also, if you ever need any energy replenishment,
    just say the word and you''ll be back in shape in no time. In return, all you
    have to do for me is to keep me entertained. '
  - This place is just where all the demons are banished to if they ever overstep
    any of the divine heaven rules. In short, this is a prison for them where they
    repent for their crimes. Depending on the severity of the crime, some of them
    are banished here for eternity.
